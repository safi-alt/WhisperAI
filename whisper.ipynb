            " Who's the carer? Is it your mum or dad? It's my mum. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. It's my mum. It's your mum, okay, right. And how long have you been the carer for her? On that particular condition? On that particular condition. Roughly, just even rough? Probably about five years. Five years, okay, that's great. And you obviously stayed with his friend for sure, that's fine, so I've got all those easy ones. That's great, thank you very much for that. So I'm going to, as I said, go on and ask you a set of questions. Obviously, you know, give me as much detail as you possibly can, but obviously feel free to opt out of any questions that you don't feel like answering. One thing I don't want to do is get you emotional or anything discussing it, because I know what the issue is like, you know, my mum and father both passed away with the same condition. Okay. Literally four or five years ago, so it's quite a tough situation to live with, but you know. So, the first question I wanted to ask was, what motivated you to assume the role of caregiver for your loved one? You know, what has it kind of drove you to become the carer? I suppose, well, we're a family of ten. Yeah, shall we? Yeah, I haven't done that. Most are married and separated in their own homes, but even men, like over a period of time, my younger siblings, so I'm towards the younger end of the ten. Oh, right, okay. So, what we've done is that, I think it was just partly, I'm the one that was still at home anyway, so it was a natural sort of situation to fall into. However, it's probably stopped me from, you know, kind of branching out and maybe actively exploring other avenues in my own life. Because of dedication to my mum, my mum's dedicated her whole life selflessly to us, and it's just, I couldn't think of anything else, or anyone else kind of doing it, so I mean, it's an honour and privilege is how I perceive it. But yeah. So, did you think, there's more a kind of sense of moral duty then, maybe? Yeah, I would say, like it's a, certainly, like obviously faith is a huge part of what motivates me. So, certainly faith, knowing that it's an obligation to, you know, to honour and respect your parents, and morally, yeah, I can imagine, I think seeing how much a mum has parented ten children, so just seeing that, and I think the sacrifices she's made in her whole life, to kind of, I don't think we can ever repay our parents, we can just do a service that hopefully is some level of care. So, just, obviously you said religion there, and how important was that, because I'm just wondering, you know, if you weren't religious, would you still kind of... I suppose it's a hard one, I suppose we, maybe actually what we can say is that through our family we have varying degrees of what you would call religiosity, I suppose. But all of us are dedicated to caring for our parents, and our mum as well, so it wouldn't be a case of, I think, with the way, I think primarily, probably the devotion mum's shown, and then obviously what keeps you in it, is knowing that it's also obligated. So, I'm just curious, because obviously you've taken on the role, and I'm just wondering if you hadn't taken on that role, had you quite confident someone else would have taken on the role? Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Had I not been the primary carer, I would have certainly been a secondary carer, yes, and I think there would have been somebody else who would have been doing primary care. So, how much time do you devote then, kind of on a daily basis, to her care? Mostly, like, so in the mornings, what I'll do is, so my mum's still relatively self-sufficient in that she can still get up and dress and do all those kind of things herself. Hi very much, the issue that she probably does have is not being able to, she won't do anything like cleaning and cooking, well, cleaning she'll still try to do, but cooking and stuff like that. She has to be encouraged to shower and stuff like that, so in the mornings what I do is I give her breakfast and her medication before I leave for work, and in the days that I'm not allocated to her family motor, I'll go to work and a sibling will come along and be with mum and dad for my working hours, and then in the evenings I'll be using much of the care, so I'll ensure that mum gets to bed properly, listen out for her, because what we're finding now is that the issues are predominantly, obviously as a result of sundown, her level of confusion is higher in the evenings, so that's where the care probably impacts more. So during the day actually she probably can be good or bad, it's variable, but she tends to be a bit more stable. Ah right, okay. But it tends to get worse, and now actually in the winter that's actually predominantly the most part of the day. A lot of things get worse in the nighttime though, as we know. Yes, yes. And do you, so you don't actually stay with her? I stay with her, I live in the house. Oh you're actually in the same house as her, right okay. And was she officially diagnosed with dementia? Yes. Right okay, and how long, about five years I think is it? Five years, yeah. Unfortunately we lost our nanny, my mum's mum, to it and it was just as we lost my nanny we got my mum's diagnosis, it was an overlap. So my nanny passed away about five years ago, and it was a similar sort of condition. Sorry, and the diagnosis, was it quite sudden? I mean was there some sudden symptoms you saw or was it something that you gradually kind of noticed? We started, I think given the fact that our nanny had been diagnosed, and then we started to see subtle changes, subtle changes in mum. My sisters are doctors, so they were probably a bit more astute to picking up on the early indicators. Yeah, yeah. But most of us maybe would have been a little bit in denial about it, or quite happy to live in denial about it. But my sister and I took mum to Umrah, that would have been 27, 28, 2018? Yeah, end of 2018. And there were periods then where her confusion was very notable, but I think there was already a diagnosis in place at that point. Good, okay, that's great. The next theme I wanted to explore was if you had any prior caregiving roles before you took on the current responsibility, did you ever have any caregiving responsibilities for anyone else? So our nanny, yeah, partly even if we cared for her. She did that for us as well. So my nanny was rested with my uncle, my mum's brother, but what we did in the initial period where she was still able, she would stay with us for some period of time and she would stay with my uncle so we would share that care. So what I actually find was comparatively when it's the grandparent it's a little bit easier, and when it's your own parent it's actually a greater challenge. So did you find that because you had done some caring for your grandmother that you kind of knew what to expect? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean my mum's pattern has been very similar, very similar. And my sisters are always just like, it's just shockingly similar because you don't typically see it in these sort of conditions, but the nature of their confusion, the type of things and their behavioural changes are so highly aligned. Okay. Before you took on the kind of activity, took on this role, did you seek support from maybe others to take on the role of caregiver before you decided yourself? Did you have like a family chat or something? Well we regularly do have family conversations and those are predominantly around allowing respite periods for myself and my younger brother who reside in the home, so it's myself and my younger brother at home. So it would be more related to that, but I think naturally what happens is that I think you'll know from Asian family dynamics that if you are living at, I mean whether you're 50 or in single and living at home, you know, you're still there if you're in that system. And I think that wasn't something that necessarily was like, you know, I'll be the caregiver or I'll be the pre-caregiver and everybody else is in support. I think naturally we all felt compelled to help mum, but obviously the ones that are home take the predominant role of caring. So that's a very important point I think you made there, that because obviously you stay at home. So I'm just wondering whether there was that kind of natural inclination for you to take on the role because you were going to stay, you obviously didn't leave. Yeah, what it's led to is the fact that it's not prevented me as such, but it's led me to be less inclined to seek out, you know, general means of like moving out and things like that. So for me, I think primarily the biggest focus is now ensuring that their care is fulfilled and then, you know, my life will take more of a priority if that makes sense. So if you don't mind, how old is your mum? Well, it's a vague one because they won't have had like three ages, but they are, I think, late 70s. Late 70s. Okay. In terms of thinking about support with family, I'm quite keen to explore whether you've actively thought or received support from healthcare professionals such as GPs, hospital consultants, social and healthcare agencies. And whether that support has been, or what kind of support that has been if you have, and whether that's been any, obviously, any effect at all. So in the initial diagnosis, mum was attending a local health centre for their elderly psych sort of support. That was when the diagnosis was coming into play and whether medication stuff, you know, looking into that, whether there was any treatment options, and that was the early days. What we found was that it wasn't really much. Mum was discharged. What they did try and support us with was getting a disability badge for the car. So, you know, we could park more conveniently if we were to take them out and things like that. Actually, that probably fell through at our own part. But on the whole, like I have a colleague here who has a child with additional support needs, so is very aware of how to gain support from a bit of Caucasian background. But what I've found is that maybe like when it comes to seeking support, if the need was there, we certainly would probably, because my sister's again being medically aware. They know about systems. One of my sisters is a GP, so she does know how the systems work and what care is available. But had that not been available, I think we would have been a bit more unaware, I suppose. And there is a reluctance because I just don't feel like there's sufficient support for people. My mum's not an English speaker. And would we be creating more anxiety for her by introducing faces that she doesn't recognise and things like that? Or how do we ensure, like, it's a whole system that's built around predominantly a Caucasian community and it doesn't really cater for things like our hygiene and how we wound. Yeah, of course. I'll come back to that later on. These are things that are really important to us, or like knowing my mum's praise and things like that, knowing how to speak on top of these sort of things. And these are the things that often people aren't aware of it. I guess because obviously the kind of condition dementia is, there's no actual cue for it. I know they're obviously working on developments and there's some positive signs for the future. But obviously, is that one of the things? I'm just wondering whether when you have had a chat with GPs or doctors about her condition, have they created any kind of action plan for her? Like, you know, say like, this is the way forward. I mean, you know, we know there's no cure, but how do we kind of keep that stable if you like the situation? Have you ever had those kinds of chats? Not really. Anything that's probably come more from my sisters who are qualified. Yes, of course. And with them, who'd be like, you know, the last thing we want to be doing is too much activity in the evening, because of the sort of sun time phenomenon. And also not keeping mum's environment as stable as possible in order to not create confusion and ensuring that we have plenty of time to wipe down in the evening so that there's not like that hyperness that can happen as well. So to see GPs and stuff like so, I mean, whether that's down to us maybe not being proactive in seeking that. But we certainly haven't had a support in that sense. But more recently, because mum's confusion levels at night have been quite considerable. I saw advice from the GP and had asked, like, she's on a general sort of anti anxiety medication, which is Sertraline. But my concern was that maybe, I mean, that's something she'd been on just for a lengthy time and without something more was needed, particularly to calm her so that she goes to bed comfortably. And it was seeking that the doctor suggested a low dose of Lorazepam if and when required kind of a thing. But personally, I also saw that like when it came to our nanny, like how much those sort of medications could really heavily sedate somebody. And we used them quite like almost like a zombie the following day. So it doesn't feel like a comfortable sort of a thing to manage the situation with. But it's there as a complete backup if there's a really bad night or something like that. Do you want to get your tea? Before I get going, that would be useful. Have you managed to do quite a few people? I've now got in total about eight or nine. So you're only the second one because of my colleague, Dina, she's doing interviews as well. She's done I think she's done two now. So that's the fourth. Yeah. So I've got another two this week in North Lanarkshire and then maybe another few before the holidays. And all we need is another three or four. So we've got technical at the end of January to do the research. So we've got another three or four to get. Hopefully if I can get those in place before the holidays and even do them in January, that would be really helpful. So it's a pilot study. So it's a small numbers. It's a scoping type of study. Yeah. So it's not too heavy going at the moment. We want to see what we get out of it, you know, because it's such an important area and our community. It's a growing issue, not just within our community. It's important that obviously, I mean, we're always talking about things like diversity and inclusion and stuff like that. It's really important that we actually, there's actually signs of that actually happening. So I think the fact that we got the funding for this is a good starting point. It's a good starting point, you know, to take that on. So I wanted to go and talk about, I suppose the most obvious question you'd probably get asked here is, what do you perceive as the key challenges in undertaking caregiving role for someone who's living with dementia? I think it's an emotional roller coaster. I've described it as a sort of a dual grief, like you're grieving the loss of somebody whilst they're still alive. And then when you lose them, when they pass, you grieve them again. So it's almost like the grief whilst they are there with you manifests itself in a whole host of different ways. Like I see it as being like your daily frustrations because you're suddenly have to parent people that have parented you. And seeing somebody become somebody that they're not as well. There's a whole, you're trying to maintain your own emotional stability whilst trying to ensure that you don't lose compassion and kindness and care and love for somebody who deserves it. So there's that, I think it's that constant internal battle more than anything else. The physical and the stuff that you just do, that's doable. But I think it's the constant emotional element that you're carrying on a daily basis, which is so variable from day to day as well. OK. That's the difficult one. I understand that. And I'm just wondering, does the nature of the condition make it even more challenging? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's the nature of the condition is what creates that whole emotional turmoil on a daily basis. It is the condition, it's unpredictability and it's actually just it's savageness. I think it's a horrible condition to just watch somebody be slowly depleted by something and have no control over that, have no way of stopping it. But just to watch somebody become almost like the absolute opposite of who they are. In reality, you start to see manifestations of all the things that they've inhibited in themselves and everything comes out. And like all the things we know that humans that, you know, Alhamdulillah is such a blessing that Allah has given us this ability to control our emotional state. Because if we were just able to express our emotions as in rain, you just see how difficult that is. Would you say that there's a cultural taboo or stigma associated with dementia, which is a potential challenge as well? I mean, the cultural aspect, I would say that we felt from external family members. We tried really hard to, I mean, Alhamdulillah, I think as a family, maybe having seen it through our own nanny, but also just with us all working in either a medical field of being aware of these things has maybe allowed us to understand it a bit better. So comparatively, my dad doesn't always get it. So it's trying to get him to understand that mum can't do all the stuff that she used to be able to do for you. Whereas he still lives in the mindset of like, she's at my service getting this out of her. So you're almost dealing with that side of things or just the frustration of like, I told you about 20 times that you prayed or something like that. But what we find with external family members is that they use it as a sort of mockery. Yeah, yeah, the relevance of people that think it's like they laugh at the sort of cyclical forgetfulness. Because it's almost just like, how could you be so silly? Like, we just literally had this conversation or somebody having a conversation about something that evidently isn't true or the case anymore. Or it's a past event or it seems almost so ridiculous because it was so far removed from current time. Do you think that's partly to do with a lack of understanding of the condition or a failure to try to maybe try to make an effort to understand what the condition is? Because it is obviously a very complicated condition. No, absolutely. And I think there's, yeah, I think it's like with any mental health condition, I still think our communities just either don't want to understand it or they oversimplify these things or they just want to brandish people as like crazy or whatever it might be. Or bring in the spiritual aspect of it and say something. Yeah, you know, there's loads of sides to it. And I think often maybe in some cases it may well be other people's coping mechanisms, you know, laugh about something because I really don't know how else to deal with it. But when you understand that when it comes to somebody going through a period of confusion, the last thing that you're supposed to kind of try and do is tell them, don't be ridiculous, this is this, you know. But when you're dealing with, so I guess what we've sort of ended up doing is maybe isolating a little bit of that in order to protect mum because mum can now obviously actively protect herself against negative responses. So we feel very protective of her in that sense. Do you think that part of people's failure to appreciate the condition is associated with the fact that there'll be times when your mum's fine when they're talking to her, other times they're not and they think, well, how could you go from one extreme to the other? Is that possible? Yeah, yeah, yeah, 12b. I think that could just be like, again, when somebody looks very functional, like mum, she'll just put her about, you know, she'll go, she's able to walk and things like that. If you see her and you talk to her, there's periods where she's very lucid. It's like, it's just mum. But then there's times where there will be complete, like either repetitiveness or confusion about time periods and things like that, where we are, who we are with and stuff like that. So, yeah, I guess for outsiders looking in, yeah, that very much would be the case. So if she's, you said that she's able to, physically she's fine in the sense that she can get up and she can go to the bathroom herself, right, and she can walk around. But am I right in saying that she's not allowed out on her own? No, no, absolutely not. So she'd always be monitored and supervised, obviously. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. But in the house, obviously, she also needs to be monitored and supervised in this case. Yeah, so we've had to ensure that it's mum proof. So, yeah, particularly, I suppose my greatest anxieties are at night, you know, actually, you know, she's accustomed to doing certain household chores. Which now we kind of take away from her. So, like, she'll occasionally try and start cooking and that's definitely not something that allows her to do. Yeah, especially when they cook. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely not. And then there will be times where she'll try and take the food bin out and put it to the ground bin. But, like, it'll be like a bad day, like if it's a day like this, she'll have her flip flops on and she'll just kind of go and do it. Second nature almost in her life. Yeah, yeah, so it's just things that she's accustomed to doing, but sometimes forgets that she's not really as able. So we try and prevent those sort of things. But at night I'm always a bit more fearful because we're not on the ground floor. Yeah. So mum's room is upstairs and my room is right opposite hers so I can listen out for her. But obviously if I'm asleep, I'm asleep and that's just, my worry is that if she starts becoming a bit more awake and confused at night, that she might like to go and just fall downstairs or something like that. Yeah, and I think that's the issue with houses and these kind of areas and I know that as well, you know, from our experience, you know, not being on the ground floor and stuff like that. Have you ever sought support from maybe religious people about her condition in any way? Yeah, I suppose. I have a teacher that I would probably regularly consult if it was more to do actually with the Islamic legal responsibility. Not so much the actual condition? Not the condition as much. I personally for my own, maybe my own spirituality, yes maybe, but for mum, it would be more a case of where does she stand with the prayer? Is she technically now somebody who by Islam doesn't have capacity or is she still responsible for actions because she falls into these cycles of being lucid and being aware? I was completely disengaged from reality so I sought advice regarding that because for me, knowing what's important to my mum and that primarily it's the faith, they've lived the whole life around it. So ensuring that me now is somebody who's caring for her, I ensure that that is something that she's able to maintain in a way that would be correct both in the faith and in the sight of God as well. So that would be the type of things that I have. So thinking about your own caring role, well the one question I want to go back to was, so your mum is never alone at home? No. No, right, you can't, so there always has to be that. That's a challenge as well in some ways isn't it? Yes it is. Ensuring that someone's around all the time. Yeah, I mean that is probably one of the things and hum to love because there's ten of us, we can generally make it work. Not all ten are in Glasgow. So at least eight of us are in Glasgow, two of us live up home and the rest are round about. So what we ensure is that seven days a week there's at least somebody home. It becomes problematic when folks are taking holidays. But would I have a bit more flexibility with my work, that works in that sense. And I've always said long term if people feel that it's getting too much for them, I would look at my work needs and see if I can reduce my hours and come back as appropriate. And obviously you've got probably your own family as well? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not married or anything so yeah, yeah. Do you think that helps? That helps. In this particular situation? Yeah, yeah, absolutely, I mean that makes it so much easier for everybody else. Yes. It means, for me it does become a very primary, that's my family, that's my nuclear family then isn't it? Yeah, of course. For me that naturally means that, which is why I haven't probably actively sought to read that. Yeah, yeah, got you. Because I just think then, as much as your parents would love to see those things, but there's a time and a place I suppose and now it's too far gone and I just feel like it is what it is now. Times are different now isn't it? It's not quite the way it used to be. Yeah, yeah, and I suppose also, again it comes back to faith, you realise that if our objective is to live through life so that we can gain paradise then whatever path that is, whatever path you need to take. It might be a different path, just because of the situation. Yeah, you take what you've bought and hopefully try and make the best of it. I couldn't disagree with that at all. So thinking about things that help you to undertake your caregiving role, and we might have slightly touched on some of those, but I want to get a more deeper understanding of what is it that helps you to do the caregiving role very effectively? What's it that makes it for you? I don't know if I do it effectively. Obviously, maybe we're not the best people to make that judgement. Yeah. God is the best judge, but I'm pretty sure that you're doing a hundred and a good job. But I'm just thinking about what it is then, forget about thinking about whether it's effective or not, but just in terms of helping you get the role done on a day to day basis, what kind of things would you say, this, this and this helps me do this role? And I think some of that you have touched on. Yeah, I think the main thing is probably just remembering how committed mum has been, like remembering our childhood and just remembering just how much, I mean, I don't know, like I certainly have loads of the young nieces and deuces and sometimes they ask you the same question about a million times and you're just like, right. But I can't imagine what it must have been like for mum to have like seven kids who were quite, we were all quite, the last seven were born quite close together. So there's maybe a one or two year gap between all of us. So we were all really young children and mum, I can't imagine how much we must have done our head in. Like payback. It's not so much that, it's just actually realising that my mum did it with such patience. I never remember being shouted at by my mum, never. Not a hand raised, nothing. There was no like harsh disciplining. There was no harshness for mum ever. So you were running wild then? We were, we were generally on the whole good kids, but honestly when I think about it, I was just like, I don't know how that happened and how she did it. But knowing that that's how mum served us, like that's like a huge motivator for me. Like how can I not get back? That's what I mean when I say payback. I mean, it's your turn now to return to favour, so to speak. Absolutely, returning that for sure. And what about in terms of your own sort of personality? I mean, one of the areas that you already touched on was religion. So obviously, even if it wasn't you returning to favour, you would do it anyway, simply out of a sense of religious duty potentially. But what about things like willpower and that kind of resilience? Do you think that helps you? Because you must have some of that if you're into things that are old. I suppose that gets fed in through these things. But willpower and resilience certainly comes from anchoring in faith. But also comes from like I have a support network of like siblings that I'm very close to, friends that I have that, you know, they'll force that kind of let's have at least a night, a month where we'll go out to dinner and just chat and stuff like that. So having that. And Hamza Lalik actually... A release mechanism in some ways. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And family, siblings who certainly encourage me to ensure that I maintain some level of sanity as well within it. Yes, yeah. So like, I mean, I enjoy, like I don't, I'm not great for exercising, but I've managed to find something now, like I do a box fit class and I really enjoy that. And it's actually probably a good reason to do a special session too. But my sisters are just like, you can't miss those classes, do it, make sure you do it. And that's something that now means that every Saturday they make sure that that is definitely factored in. Yeah. They get to do that. So it's knowing that there's people there supporting it and also actually just here in the workplace. A few, I don't tend to let everyone know about these sort of things, but there's a few people that work closely with who do know and they check in with you and who maybe had similar experiences and so can very much relate to that. And so that, I think as humans, we're creatures of association as well, aren't we? We like to feel a sense of belonging because somebody understands your situation. I think it gives us a bit more in the way of grounding as well. So that's quite an important thing for you then, that kind of social exercise activity for your kind of mental and physical wellbeing. I would say it used to, I mean, I probably used to be more of a socialiser and then the pandemic happened and I just didn't care about it. I actually became socially exhausted very easily. So I am actually quite a homely person anyway. I enjoy the company of my family. But I know that I need to have a period of time where, I mean, I think if I didn't work as well, that would have a huge impact. I was constantly, seven days a week. So is that a coping mechanism in some ways and helping you to... Maybe, maybe. I think it breaks up the day, it breaks up the constants. The monotony if you like. Or I think just if you're constantly in it and I think if you're in there 24-7, that becomes difficult. That certainly does become difficult and it becomes a lot harder. And what you then realise is, you know, the cliche terms that you hear, you can't pour from an empty cup and blah, blah, blah. All of those kind of things, right? But it's true. What you do feel is that if you're being seeped of your, like you said, resilience and willpower, then you can't actually give a positive... You see, I'm just wondering because obviously you do have that, you know, to some extent some of that additional support network around about you, that close relation with your family. And that helps you to do the job even more effectively because obviously they are chipping in. Obviously you are still the primary caregiver but because of the fact that they are able to chip in, the fact that there's someone there when you're at work and all that, that must also help your do the role. Yeah, absolutely. Knowing that there's that safety net to that extent and knowing that, you know, there is that allowance for me to maintain some level of personal identity. Does that make sense? So I'm just doing my job and things like that. These are just personal goals that you have. So having the ability to be able to do that without guilt or without any other... There can be days where you feel guilty about it, but without having to worry that there's nobody there or you're having to rely on somebody completely alien to mum and dad and things like that. So it's nice to know that you've got a familiar face and it doesn't feel like an obscurity to them. So I'm going to go on to talk a little bit about, and again you may have slightly touched on this because some of the themes tend to overlap. How does undertaking a caregiving role impact your personal or wider family life? And I think you've already touched on that a little bit. Yeah, so I suppose it does create tensions. What tends to happen is we find that the blessing of being a big family and then it comes with its curses as well. Trust me, it even happens in all sizes of families. So you find that naturally there's different dynamics and different personality types. There's different commitments, there's different people who have different priorities. So what we tend to find is that that politics that can come into play can be problematic. So as much as we're close and we all have the shared objectives, sharing mum and dad are looked after, it can become a bit edgy when people feel like they're not getting enough time out or they're getting too much people done. And that tends to be less the people that are the primary caregivers and more the people that are supporting it. So for example, a sibling needing a period of time off the rota, we call it the family rota, because he's gone on holiday but maybe has had multiple holidays in that year and it's multiple occasions then. And it's just not having insight as to how that's fine, you can do that, but it puts us in another particular area where we're struggling. And actually what you'll find is that the primary caregivers don't get that opportunity to take the luxury of mugs on holidays or any holiday. So that can sometimes create a bit of issues. But when it comes to the wider family, I suppose we think more about how we engage now, as in like visiting family we probably don't do quite as much. We certainly, as now the children, try to fulfil mum and dad's obligations of showing face in certain situations, whether it be in a group or in marriages or whatever else, that there is representation from the family, because that would be important to our parents. But certainly we don't like to engage mum in being out and about at family houses, in the evenings in particular. So that sort of a thing, yeah. So you talked about obviously that you try to get out maybe once a month, even just for like a catch up with your friends and stuff like that. And do you feel that that is something that is affected in the sense that you would like to do maybe more of that if it was possible? That's probably my own personal choice. That's my personality that probably doesn't create that in the sense that I will look at, if there's a few social things coming up, I will pick the priority and then maybe go actually I can't do too much. Because I'd feel guilty about it. And that probably leads to not doing... But sorry, but you would do those things if you were maybe looking after your mum or you didn't have that responsibility. Yeah, I think I probably... At least some of those. At least some, maybe more than maybe what I do. Yeah, probably. But again, I think it would be a case of, depending on how socially exhausted I am by that time, but whether that's... So I suppose it's a hard question to answer in the sense that a lot of my exhaustion probably comes from being a caregiver, because you're constantly engaged in that. And whether that leads to me then being too tired to want to commit to socialising as well. I want to just backtrack slightly, because something asked in the previous theme about factors that help you undertake your care load effectively. And you mentioned that word pandemic, right? And I wanted to just go back to that for a second. I want to know that, how did that change, if anything, the way you... Because obviously you said your mum's had the condition for about five years. Yeah, so during the pandemic she was diagnosed. It would have been quite close to that time. No, actually, yeah, she had the condition for a couple of years. So I'm just wondering, what was the experience like during the pandemic in terms of the care responsibility? Because I'm assuming you would have been more at home at that time. Yeah, we were all limited, obviously. Actually what we found was... So at that point it was me, my younger sister and my younger brother, because my younger sister had at that point got married. But I was actually calmer. It was actually one of the most pleasant times, if I was to say anything. I think sometimes... because, yeah, I think mum was pretty relaxed, dad was pretty relaxed. The only thing that was a bit of an issue was my dad ended up with Covid at the time and my mum was trying to... So dad had to isolate within the home. That's quite, which isn't obviously very challenging. Yeah, and definitely not easy at all when mum's just all about, like, well, let me go in and check and let me go in. So we had to... that was probably the most challenging time, but other than that, actually, I think during that period of time... Coped reasonably well. Yeah, yeah. What about the wider interaction? Because I'm assuming then, the ones that have been some of your siblings and maybe weren't able to come up or it was too risky or... Yeah, we certainly did. I mean, some completely ignored the advice because some are like that and some maintain that and they would probably just visit the garden or something like that. Yeah, from a distance. Yeah, it was challenging. And I've got a sister who lives down south, she would face time every day, multiple times a day. So it kind of kept things engaged in that regard. That's great. Yeah. So also the pandemic didn't have too much of a negative impact. No, no, no, no. I think it probably led to, I think probably some fond memories with mum and dad were created as it was up to them. What I wanted to talk about a bit was services again. And I'm just thinking, you know, if you think just think about the role that you do just now. You know, are there any specific services or support do you believe carers like yourself would welcome to enhance the caregiving experience and create a more positive environment for people with dementia? I think what we often don't get enough of is probably psychological support. I think I'm a firm believer in, I think counselling and therapy is a really positive thing to have. For carers obviously. For carers, yeah, absolutely for carers. And I think it's almost like something that a standard which should be offered. I mean, spiritual resilience is one thing, but understanding that there's a whole, like I said, because I think at the core of all of every carer is this emotional turmoil, which I think when you're in the thick of it, you can't rationalise it. And what therapy allows you to do is rationalise your emotions or at least try and cope with them and developing some sort of, you know, mentally safe coping mechanisms, if that makes sense. So I think that would be one of the things because I find myself looking to every so often I tell myself, like, I need to seek this out. And then it becomes such a challenge to try and find something appropriate that I just kind of fall back. So you have tried to look for counseling? Yeah, I mean, probably like, again, my colleagues and friends have recommended like Alzheimer's Society and Dementia UK who offer some sort of, you know, talking options and stuff like that. And sometimes what I find difficult is the fact that, you know, I think what we generally as a community of either Muslim or South Asians, we lack people who work in these services who have an understanding of the culture or the things so that they can then actually support you fully in that. So I think that's the thing. And similarly, it would be things like, the question was related to what services would be available to caregivers. Yeah, that you would welcome, that would help you to do the job more effectively, whether that's direct support for you or indirectly for the care person. Knowing that when I conditioned Fancis and Mum's awareness of who's around her would change and she'd be less aware because following the same theme is what my Nani went through. I suppose then just having somebody who's a buddy, like somebody who would sit in care or keep her company if I needed to run out and do some tours, something like that. But somebody again from our background who understands things like, you know, the hygiene elements and appreciates that, like, you know, my mum would like to have her head covered all of the time. And female carer. Yeah, absolutely. And respects that kind of a thing. And, you know, understands the sort of dignity and the way that we approach certain things as well. I'm curious about that because I'm just thinking about the, you know, I don't know whether you're aware that there are various groups and associations specifically for carers where people meet and a carers network and actually talk about the experiences they have of looking after someone with dementia. I don't know whether that was something you would want more information on. I mean, I mean, anything is really just welcomed. Recently I travelled in an Islamic group trip. That was my respite. Oh, right. If I was away for about five days and actually on that, we did an exercise, we were reflecting the trip and my reflection was very much based around like needing a break from care and from a parent explaining that situation. And then from that, actually, I found that there was a number of people who were caring for elderly carers in that group as well. And what I found there from all over the world, but what we now do is we're kind of keeping in touch and checking in with each other, which is nice. And prior to that, when I went to an Omrah trip in a group as well, something similar happened there where another lady was on the trip, but ended up with her father who was suffering with dementia. I think his was Alzheimer's and it rapidly declined. So she then thought she came to me for that support. And I think we do that. There's a natural seeking. Like I said, association. Knowing somebody who understands the struggle because it's almost like there's less judgment because it's very easy to look at somebody who is struggling. And we get these sort of passive comments sometimes particularly from our community or faith based individuals that just just bear it with patience, just bear it with patience. And then you just like the reality. You want to talk to the reality of the struggle and be able to be honest about that, but necessarily being judged. Talking is important as a release mechanism. Sometimes just talking can help. Just offload it and feel like somebody's heard you, not judged you and maybe even offered some advice or support that can help you. One of the things I'm interested in is thinking about how services can help, even if you're not specifically out there looking for services to support you because you feel that you've got more or less all bases covered because obviously yourself doing all the main helping and you've obviously got people around you like siblings. I'm just wondering, you know, is there any kind of update that you provide to say the GP or any hospital consultant to say, look, this is where mum's at now. This is what's happening. No, and I think that's probably the unfortunate thing. Is that a gap then in some ways? Yeah, certainly I would say that there's no real, I mean, the community, the initial sort of attending like the elderly psych, that was certainly a nice thing to have. I initiated that mum get re-referred back into that now because I think her condition is certainly declining a bit more significantly and I think greater support will be required in having the insight of those individuals would be of benefit to us earlier on so that if we do need to request further care support. So what happened with our nanny was that carers used to come in full time today because actually then she wasn't able to go to the bathroom and she had to obviously have all of that, you know, cared for as dignity. Yeah, and that was difficult for people who don't have the expertise maybe. Yeah, yeah, so I mean I was involved in like being with her and things like that but these are all things that we envisage happening. Was that more challenging obviously because the condition, your hands condition was worse? Well, so that was at the latter part. Like I said, my nanny's condition was very similar to my mum's. The decline? The same path of the... Yeah, yeah, so the pattern of decline is very similar. So initially it was just periods of confusion and then forgetfulness and then confusing which time period they were in. Fantatically looking for children which are now grown up and things like that. So my mum's at that phase now. But eventually what happens is this sort of cognitive decline is that parts of your brain start shutting down so my nanny stopped eating and then stopped obviously... Yeah, and the moods change and the aggression begins and stuff like that so it's what we anticipate if a laggard's mum's life that that's probably the path that she'll take. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, so as I said that's quite... Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, about the experience that your gran had with carers coming in. Obviously there's always a possibility that that might have to happen for your mum at some point. Hopefully not for a long time but it could. So I'm just thinking, do you have any views about the quality of care that was provided? Because obviously this was external care and I just wanted to know because one of the criticism often of the system is, and I think you alluded to it earlier on, was that perhaps the lack of cultural sensitivity in that care so... We were very fortunate. There were two publication ladies but I think maybe one, because there's the morning shift and the night shift, I think generally the morning shift ones were really lovely. After they would have cleaned my nanny up they would have always put her scarf back on her and things like that so it was really sweet and highly cured for her. And they were non Muslim carers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we really appreciated what they did and obviously I think they saw how important it was or how, like my mum did a lot for my nanny as well and they saw with which, what level he was caring for and they tried to kind of align it with that. I know that that's not always the case. But I think what is helpful is having siblings who have that understanding of how the system works and what we can do if something isn't working in that dynamic. There is always concerns that the care system isn't really tailored for us, it really isn't. But we aren't like a, you know, I think we remain almost like an afterthought when these sort of things develop. But I suppose that's where we have to take greater responsibility to vocalise these things. And that's hopefully what we have to do with it. We'll come to the last couple of themes. See if you were going to give a message to anyone who wanted to consider taking on the role of a caregiver for a family member living with dementia, what would be your advice? Like, you know, if you had like a couple of minutes to say, OK, here's a pitch and this is what I would advise, given my experience of being a caregiver for someone who's got that condition, what would be your message to that individual? I suppose it would be expect it to be difficult, but know that it will be rewarding. And don't struggle, don't just silently take on the burden, but seek out help along the way. I think that's one of the key things I would say. I think if I had that, like for me, again, it comes down to, but also I suppose increasingly, maybe like as our generations change as well, maybe the attitudes of what that is, you know, is it my obligation to care for elders? And it would be really sad from my own perspective, maybe I am old school, but I very much would think that don't ever lose sight of what your parents are because they do. They have cared for you in a way that you'll never be able to repay it. And I think don't see them as a burden and see it as a privilege. That's very good advice. I think that would certainly help someone make that decision, whether they go down that path or not, but ultimately the individual choice. Yeah, absolutely. And it's certainly not an easy choice. No, no, I can't imagine that. Final thought, Seem is, considering the often overlooked and invisible nature of the caregiving role, how do you envisage caregivers having their voices heard and acknowledged in society? Because a lot of people don't know what you do. I know it because I've reached out, you've come forward. But people around the country probably don't know really what it is like being a caregiver. And I just wondered, how do we get society to understand the sort of important valuable contribution that you're making to obviously your loved one? Because obviously there will be countless other people's similar stories and similar situations that we don't know about. How do we get that out there? I suppose, I mean, maybe what we need is something similar to or maybe branches of charities like Alzheimer's UK or Dimension UK or Alzheimer's Society and Dimension UK could have specific branches which are based for ethnic minorities. I don't think that's a divisive thing. I think it's recognised that we are a multicultural society and one size doesn't fit all when it comes to providing advice and care and what support. And having people within your societies, we just probably have to look at those charities and how representative they are of the population for you to see whether they actually have those voices on their charities as well and their panels. I think it would just be something as simple as having voices in the right places, or bodies in the right places. I mean, research which informs this kind of a thing. Unless we are allowed to sit at the table, our voices will always be diminished, I suppose. Maybe that's me talking about purely from a minority perspective, but in the same sort of way, I know that those charities broadly are made up with carers having a voice there. But do we have enough of every type of... People in different diverse groups. And do you think that not only having those voices heard, but also having those voices heard in important aspects of shaping policies? Oh absolutely. I think it is. It's so unfortunate that we are in the current political situation that we are in. We have a government that actually cares very little for the society as a whole and it's very much based around filling its own pockets. And there's been a complete disregard for the level of... I mean, it's not just caregivers in the sense that those who care for elders or people with additional support needs, it's caregivers as in mothers and fathers. They are also caregivers to young vulnerable children. But that whole system, that welfare system that would have been beneficial to people has been absolutely decimated. And as a result, people like ourselves are put in situations where we do have to balance both at the plate and ensure that we are able to care and support for. But having a voice in the right places, I mean, maybe I'm a bit jaded, but I don't know how much our voices count when it comes to policy. I just don't think this political system is geared towards anybody really having an substantial impact in that sense. Well, I have to say it's been very insightful listening to it and I just wanted to know if you have any final comments that you wanted to make about this? No, no, no. I mean, I think the research is great to see and obviously if there's any future avenues to support it further, I would be more than happy to do so. That's an absolute pleasure. Thank you very much. I'm going to stop recording at this point.\n"
